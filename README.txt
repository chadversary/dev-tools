Chad's Development Tools

Summary
=======
These are little scripts that I use to for setting up my environment, building
projects, etc.

There are no stability guarantees here, other than "it works for me".


How to Install
==============
Configure:

    $ cp config.mk.example config.mk
    $ ed config.mk

Then build and install:

    $ make
    $ make install

Don't like it? Then uninstall:

    $ make uninstall
